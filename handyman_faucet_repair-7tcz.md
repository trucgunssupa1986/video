## Why Repairing a Faucet Matters  

A leaky or malfunctioning faucet isnâ€™t just an annoyanceâ€”it can lead to:  
- **Water wastage:** A single dripping faucet can waste hundreds of gallons of water annually.  
- **Increased water bills:** Even a small leak can significantly inflate your utility costs.  
- **Damage to fixtures:** Constant dripping can corrode sinks, countertops, and pipes over time.  
- **Mold growth:** Excess moisture from leaks creates an ideal environment for mold and mildew.  

By repairing your faucet quickly, you not only save money but also protect your home from long-term damage.  

## What Determines the Cost of Faucet Repair?  

The cost of faucet repair depends on several factors:  

| **Factor**               | **Description**                                                                 |  
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Type of Faucet**       | Repairing a basic compression faucet is often cheaper than a cartridge or ball faucet. |  
| **Severity of the Issue** | A simple washer replacement costs less than fixing a corroded or broken valve.        |  
| **Parts Needed**         | High-quality replacement parts may increase the cost but ensure durability.         |  
| **Labor Time**           | Complex repairs or hard-to-reach faucets may require more time and effort.            |  

On average, faucet repair in Los Angeles ranges from $75 to $200, depending on the factors above. Always ask for a detailed estimate before starting the repair.
