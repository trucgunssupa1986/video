## Why Moen Faucets Are Worth Repairing  
Moen faucets are known for their durability, sleek design, and advanced technology. However, even the best faucets can develop issues over time, such as leaks from the handle. Repairing a Moen faucet is often more cost-effective than replacing it, especially since Moen offers a lifetime warranty on many of its products. By addressing the leak promptly, you can:  
- Save water and reduce utility bills.  
- Prevent further damage to your plumbing system.  
- Maintain the aesthetic appeal of your kitchen or bathroom.  

## What Causes a Moen Faucet to Leak from the Handle?  
Understanding the root cause of the leak is essential for an effective repair. Common reasons include:  
1. **Worn-out Cartridge**: The cartridge inside the handle controls water flow and can wear out over time.  
2. **Loose Handle**: Frequent use can loosen the handle, causing water to seep through.  
3. **Damaged O-Rings**: Small rubber seals (O-rings) can degrade, leading to leaks.  
4. **Mineral Buildup**: Hard water can cause deposits that interfere with the faucetâ€™s components.
