## Common Causes of a Leaking Faucet

Several factors can contribute to a faucet leak. Here are the most common culprits:

1. **Worn-Out Washer**: The washer inside the faucet handle can wear down over time, causing leaks. This is especially common in compression-style faucets.
2. **Faulty O-Ring**: The O-ring is a small rubber seal that can degrade or become loose, leading to leaks around the handle.
3. **Corroded Valve Seat**: The valve seat connects the faucet and the spout. If it corrodes, it can cause leaks near the spout.
4. **Loose or Damaged Parts**: Screws, nuts, or other components can become loose or damaged, allowing water to escape.
5. **High Water Pressure**: Excessively high water pressure can strain your faucet and cause leaks.

## Benefits of Fixing a Leaking Faucet

Addressing a leaking faucet offers several advantages:

- **Saves Water**: Even a small drip can waste hundreds of gallons of water annually.
- **Reduces Bills**: Fixing the leak lowers your water and energy bills (if hot water is involved).
- **Prevents Damage**: Leaks can lead to mold, mildew, or structural damage if left unattended.
- **Improves Functionality**: A properly functioning faucet is more convenient and efficient.
